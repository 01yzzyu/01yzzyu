+ 😄 I am Zhongyu Yang and working as a Remote Research Intern at Vision-CAIR, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), supervised by Mohamed Elhoseiny. Prior to that, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Management from Lanzhou University, China.
+ 💡 I'm profoundly interested in **Multimodal Large Language Model** and **Diffusion-based GenAI**(e.g. **2D/3D AIGC**, **Medical Image Analysis** and **Digital Human**). Recently, I focused on enhancing MLLM's reasoning via multi-prompts and Multi-modal token compression for efficient modeling.
+ 🏀 I am a big fan of the **Los Angeles Lakers**!
+ In my past research, I am most interested in **2D/3D AIGC**. In the short term, I hope to make a Controllable and Editable Generative Model to better understand Multimodal input, not just the Prompt and Visual Encoder. 
+ My long-term research Goal is to develop Intelligent Machines that can actively perceive, analyze, and interpret human states, behaviors, and potential motivations in dynamic scenes.
+ Looking for a **PhD position** and **Research Intern position** now.
