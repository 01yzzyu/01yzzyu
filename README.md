+ 😄 My name is Zhongyu Yang, and a final year undergraduate student at [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathenglish.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.
+ 💡 I'm profoundly interested in **3D Computer Vision** and **Diffusion-based GenAI**(e.g. 2D/3D AIGC, Medical Image Analysis and Digital Human).
+ 🏀 I am a big fan of the **Los Angeles Lakers**!
+ 🌱 I am also keen on **Traveling**, **Basketball**, and **Go**!
+ In my past research, I am most interested in 2D/3D AIGC. In the short term, I hope to make a controllable and editable generative model to better understand multimodal input, not just prompt and visual encoder. My long-term research goal is to develop intelligent machines that can actively perceive, analyze and interpret human states, behaviors and potential motivations in dynamic scenes.
