+ 😄 My name is Zhongyu Yang and a final year undergraduate student at [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://mathenglish.lzu.edu.cn/), [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), majoring in Mathematics(the basic theory class), minoring Administrative Management.
+ 💡 I'm profoundly interested in **3D Computer Vision** and **Diffusion-based GenAI**(e.g. **2D/3D AIGC**, **Medical Image Analysis** and **Digital Human**). Recently, I focused on RAG based on Web-Search via multi-prompt.
+ 🏀 I am a big fan of the **Los Angeles Lakers**!
+ 🌱 I am also keen on **Traveling**, **Basketball**, and **Swimming!**
+ In my past research, I am most interested in **2D/3D AIGC**. In the short term, I hope to make a Controllable and Editable Generative Model to better understand Multimodal input, not just Prompt and Visual Encoder. 
+ My long-term research Goal is to develop Intelligent Machines that can actively perceive, analyze, and interpret human states, behaviors, and potential motivations in dynamic scenes.
+ Looking for a **PhD position** and **Research Intern position** now.
